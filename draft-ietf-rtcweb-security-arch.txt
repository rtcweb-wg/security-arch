1.  Introduction

   The Real-Time Communications on the Web (WebRTC) working group is
   tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications
   between Web browsers.  The major use cases for WebRTC technology are
   real-time audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data
   transfer.  Unlike most conventional real-time systems, (e.g., SIP-
   based[RFC3261] soft phones) WebRTC communications are directly
   controlled by some Web server, via a JavaScript (JS) API as shown in
   Figure 1.

                     Figure 1: A simple WebRTC system

   A more complicated system might allow for interdomain calling, as
   shown in Figure 2.  The protocol to be used between the domains is
   not standardized by WebRTC, but given the installed base and the form
   of the WebRTC API is likely to be something SDP-based like SIP.

                   Figure 2: A multidomain WebRTC system

   This system presents a number of new security challenges, which are
   analyzed in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security].  This document describes a
   security architecture for WebRTC which addresses the threats and
   requirements described in that document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Trust Model

   The basic assumption of this architecture is that network resources
   exist in a hierarchy of trust, rooted in the browser, which serves as
   the user's TRUSTED COMPUTING BASE (TCB).  Any security property which
   the user wishes to have enforced must be ultimately guaranteed by the
   browser (or transitively by some property the browser verifies).
   Conversely, if the browser is compromised, then no security
   guarantees are possible.  Note that there are cases (e.g., Internet
   kiosks) where the user can't really trust the browser that much.  In
   these cases, the level of security provided is limited by how much
   they trust the browser.

   Optimally, we would not rely on trust in any entities other than the
   browser.  However, this is unfortunately not possible if we wish to
   have a functional system.  Other network elements fall into two

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   categories:  those which can be authenticated by the browser and thus
   are partly trusted--though to the minimum extent necessary--and those
   which cannot be authenticated and thus are untrusted.

3.1.  Authenticated Entities

   There are two major classes of authenticated entities in the system:

   o  Calling services:  Web sites whose origin we can verify (optimally
      via HTTPS, but in some cases because we are on a topologically
      restricted network, such as behind a firewall, and can infer
      authentication from firewall behavior).
   o  Other users:  WebRTC peers whose origin we can verify
      cryptographically (optimally via DTLS-SRTP).

   Note that merely being authenticated does not make these entities
   trusted.  For instance, just because we can verify that
   https://www.evil.org/ is owned by Dr. Evil does not mean that we can
   trust Dr. Evil to access our camera and microphone.  However, it
   gives the user an opportunity to determine whether he wishes to trust
   Dr. Evil or not; after all, if he desires to contact Dr. Evil
   (perhaps to arrange for ransom payment), it's safe to temporarily
   give him access to the camera and microphone for the purpose of the
   call, but he doesn't want Dr. Evil to be able to access his camera
   and microphone other than during the call.  The point here is that we
   must first identify other elements before we can determine whether
   and how much to trust them.  Additionally, sometimes we need to
   identify the communicating peer before we know what policies to
   apply.

   It's also worth noting that there are settings where authentication
   is non-cryptographic, such as other machines behind a firewall.
   Naturally, the level of trust one can have in identities verified in
   this way depends on how strong the topology enforcement is.

3.2.  Unauthenticated Entities

   Other than the above entities, we are not generally able to identify
   other network elements, thus we cannot trust them.  This does not
   mean that it is not possible to have any interaction with them, but
   it means that we must assume that they will behave maliciously and
   design a system which is secure even if they do so.


4.  Overview

   This section describes a typical RTCWeb session and shows how the
   various security elements interact and what guarantees are provided

   to the user.  The example in this section is a "best case" scenario
   in which we provide the maximal amount of user authentication and
   media privacy with the minimal level of trust in the calling service.
   Simpler versions with lower levels of security are also possible and
   are noted in the text where applicable.  It's also important to
   recognize the tension between security (or performance) and privacy.
   The example shown here is aimed towards settings where we are more
   concerned about secure calling than about privacy, but as we shall
   see, there are settings where one might wish to make different
   tradeoffs--this architecture is still compatible with those settings.

   For the purposes of this example, we assume the topology shown in the
   figures below.  This topology is derived from the topology shown in
   Figure 1, but separates Alice and Bob's identities from the process
   of signaling.  Specifically, Alice and Bob have relationships with
   some Identity Provider (IdP) that supports a protocol such as OpenID
   or BrowserID) that can be used to demonstrate their identity to other
   parties.  For instance, Alice might have an account with a social
   network which she can then use to authenticate to other web sites
   without explicitly having an account with those sites; this is a
   fairly conventional pattern on the Web. Section 5.6.1 provides an
   overview of Identity Providers and the relevant terminology.  Alice
   and Bob might have relationships with different IdPs as well.

   This separation of identity provision and signaling isn't
   particularly important in "closed world" cases where Alice and Bob
   are users on the same social network and have identities based on
   that domain (Figure 3) However, there are important settings where
   that is not the case, such as federation (calls from one domain to
   another; Figure 4) and calling on untrusted sites, such as where two
   users who have a relationship via a given social network want to call
   each other on another, untrusted, site, such as a poker site.

   Note that the servers themselves are also authenticated by an
   external identity service, the SSL/TLS certificate infrastructure
   (not shown).  As is conventional in the Web, all identities are
   ultimately rooted in that system.  For instance, when an IdP makes an
   identity assertion, the Relying Party consuming that assertion is
   able to verify because it is able to connect to the IdP via HTTPS.

   Figure 4 shows essentially the same calling scenario but with a call
   between two separate domains (i.e., a federated case), as in
   Figure 2.  As mentioned above, the domains communicate by some
   unspecified protocol and providing separate signaling and identity
   allows for calls to be authenticated regardless of the details of the
   inter-domain protocol.

            Figure 4: A federated call with IdP-based identity

4.1.  Initial Signaling

   For simplicity, assume the topology in Figure 3.  Alice and Bob are
   both users of a common calling service; they both have approved the
   calling service to make calls (we defer the discussion of device
   access permissions till later).  They are both connected to the
   calling service via HTTPS and so know the origin with some level of
   confidence.  They also have accounts with some identity provider.
   This sort of identity service is becoming increasingly common in the
   Web environment in technologies such (BrowserID, Federated Google
   Login, Facebook Connect, OAuth, OpenID, WebFinger), and is often
   provided as a side effect service of a user's ordinary accounts with
   some service.  In this example, we show Alice and Bob using a
   separate identity service, though the identity service may be the
   same entity as the calling service or there may be no identity
   service at all.

   Alice is logged onto the calling service and decides to call Bob. She
   can see from the calling service that he is online and the calling

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   service presents a JS UI in the form of a button next to Bob's name
   which says "Call".  Alice clicks the button, which initiates a JS
   callback that instantiates a PeerConnection object.  This does not
   require a security check:  JS from any origin is allowed to get this
   far.

   Once the PeerConnection is created, the calling service JS needs to
   set up some media.  Because this is an audio/video call, it creates a
   MediaStream with two MediaStreamTracks, one connected to an audio
   input and one connected to a video input.  At this point the first
   security check is required:  untrusted origins are not allowed to
   access the camera and microphone, so the browser prompts Alice for
   permission.

   In the current W3C API, once some streams have been added, Alice's
   browser + JS generates a signaling message [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep]
   containing:

   o  Media channel information
   o  Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] candidates
   o  A fingerprint attribute binding the communication to a key pair
      [RFC5763].  Note that this key may simply be ephemerally generated
      for this call or specific to this domain, and Alice may have a
      large number of such keys.

   Prior to sending out the signaling message, the PeerConnection code
   contacts the identity service and obtains an assertion binding
   Alice's identity to her fingerprint.  The exact details depend on the
   identity service (though as discussed in Section 5.6 PeerConnection
   can be agnostic to them), but for now it's easiest to think of as a
   BrowserID assertion.  The assertion may bind other information to the
   identity besides the fingerprint, but at minimum it needs to bind the
   fingerprint.

   This message is sent to the signaling server, e.g., by XMLHttpRequest
   [XmlHttpRequest] or by WebSockets [RFC6455]. preferably over TLS
   [RFC5246].  The signaling server processes the message from Alice's
   browser, determines that this is a call to Bob and sends a signaling
   message to Bob's browser (again, the format is currently undefined).
   The JS on Bob's browser processes it, and alerts Bob to the incoming
   call and to Alice's identity.  In this case, Alice has provided an
   identity assertion and so Bob's browser contacts Alice's identity
   provider (again, this is done in a generic way so the browser has no
   specific knowledge of the IdP) to verify the assertion.  This allows
   the browser to display a trusted element in the browser chrome
   indicating that a call is coming in from Alice.  If Alice is in Bob's
   address book, then this interface might also include her real name, a
   picture, etc.  The calling site will also provide some user interface



Rescorla                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   element (e.g., a button) to allow Bob to answer the call, though this
   is most likely not part of the trusted UI.

   If Bob agrees a PeerConnection is instantiated with the message from
   Alice's side.  Then, a similar process occurs as on Alice's browser:
   Bob's browser prompts him for device permission, the media streams
   are created, and a return signaling message containing media
   information, ICE candidates, and a fingerprint is sent back to Alice
   via the signaling service.  If Bob has a relationship with an IdP,
   the message will also come with an identity assertion.

   At this point, Alice and Bob each know that the other party wants to
   have a secure call with them.  Based purely on the interface provided
   by the signaling server, they know that the signaling server claims
   that the call is from Alice to Bob. This level of security is
   provided merely by having the fingerprint in the message and having
   that message received securely from the signaling server.  Because
   the far end sent an identity assertion along with their message, they
   know that this is verifiable from the IdP as well.  Note that if the
   call is federated, as shown in Figure 4 then Alice is able to verify
   Bob's identity in a way that is not mediated by either her signaling
   server or Bob's.  Rather, she verifies it directly with Bob's IdP.

   Of course, the call works perfectly well if either Alice or Bob
   doesn't have a relationship with an IdP; they just get a lower level
   of assurance.  I.e., they simply have whatever information their
   calling site claims about the caller/calllee's identity.  Moreover,
   Alice might wish to make an anonymous call through an anonymous
   calling site, in which case she would of course just not provide any
   identity assertion and the calling site would mask her identity from
   Bob.

4.2.  Media Consent Verification

   As described in ([I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]; Section 4.2) media
   consent verification is provided via ICE.  Thus, Alice and Bob
   perform ICE checks with each other.  At the completion of these
   checks, they are ready to send non-ICE data.

   At this point, Alice knows that (a) Bob (assuming he is verified via
   his IdP) or someone else who the signaling service is claiming is Bob
   is willing to exchange traffic with her and (b) that either Bob is at
   the IP address which she has verified via ICE or there is an attacker
   who is on-path to that IP address detouring the traffic.  Note that
   it is not possible for an attacker who is on-path between Alice and
   Bob but not attached to the signaling service to spoof these checks
   because they do not have the ICE credentials.  Bob has the same
   security guarantees with respect to Alice.

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


4.3.  DTLS Handshake

   Once the ICE checks have completed [more specifically, once some ICE
   checks have completed], Alice and Bob can set up a secure channel or
   channels.  This is performed via DTLS [RFC4347] (for the data
   channel) and DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763] keying for SRTP [RFC3711] for the
   media channel and SCTP over DTLS [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps]
   for data channels.  Specifically, Alice and Bob perform a DTLS
   handshake on every channel which has been established by ICE.  The
   total number of channels depends on the amount of muxing; in the most
   likely case we are using both RTP/RTCP mux and muxing multiple media
   streams on the same channel, in which case there is only one DTLS
   handshake.  Once the DTLS handshake has completed, the keys are
   exported [RFC5705] and used to key SRTP for the media channels.

   At this point, Alice and Bob know that they share a set of secure
   data and/or media channels with keys which are not known to any
   third-party attacker.  If Alice and Bob authenticated via their IdPs,
   then they also know that the signaling service is not mounting a man-
   in-the-middle attack on their traffic.  Even if they do not use an
   IdP, as long as they have minimal trust in the signaling service not
   to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, they know that their
   communications are secure against the signaling service as well
   (i.e., that the signaling service cannot mount a passive attack on
   the communications).

4.4.  Communications and Consent Freshness

   From a security perspective, everything from here on in is a little
   anticlimactic:  Alice and Bob exchange data protected by the keys
   negotiated by DTLS.  Because of the security guarantees discussed in
   the previous sections, they know that the communications are
   encrypted and authenticated.

   The one remaining security property we need to establish is "consent
   freshness", i.e., allowing Alice to verify that Bob is still prepared
   to receive her communications so that Alice does not continue to send
   large traffic volumes to entities which went abruptly offline.  ICE
   specifies periodic STUN keepalizes but only if media is not flowing.
   Because the consent issue is more difficult here, we require RTCWeb
   implementations to periodically send keepalives.  As described in
   Section 5.3, these keepalives MUST be based on the consent freshness
   mechanism specified in [I-D.muthu-behave-consent-freshness].  If a
   keepalive fails and no new ICE channels can be established, then the
   session is terminated.

5.  Detailed Technical Description

5.1.  Origin and Web Security Issues

   The basic unit of permissions for WebRTC is the origin [RFC6454].
   Because the security of the origin depends on being able to
   authenticate content from that origin, the origin can only be
   securely established if data is transferred over HTTPS [RFC2818].
   Thus, clients MUST treat HTTP and HTTPS origins as different
   permissions domains.  [Note:  this follows directly from the origin
   security model and is stated here merely for clarity.]

   Many web browsers currently forbid by default any active mixed
   content on HTTPS pages.  That is, when JavaScript is loaded from an
   HTTP origin onto an HTTPS page, an error is displayed and the HTTP
   content is not executed unless the user overrides the error.  Any
   browser which enforces such a policy will also not permit access to
   WebRTC functionality from mixed content pages (because they never
   display mixed content).  Browsers which allow active mixed content
   MUST nevertheless disable WebRTC functionality in mixed content
   settings.

   Note that it is possible for a page which was not mixed content to
   become mixed content during the duration of the call.  The major risk
   here is that the newly arrived insecure JS might redirect media to a
   location controlled by the attacker.  Implementations MUST either
   choose to terminate the call or display a warning at that point.

5.2.  Device Permissions Model

   Implementations MUST obtain explicit user consent prior to providing
   access to the camera and/or microphone.  Implementations MUST at
   minimum support the following two permissions models for HTTPS
   origins.

   o  Requests for one-time camera/microphone access.
   o  Requests for permanent access.

   Because HTTP origins cannot be securely established against network
   attackers, implementations MUST NOT allow the setting of permanent
   access permissions for HTTP origins.  Implementations MAY also opt to
   refuse all permissions grants for HTTP origins, but it is RECOMMENDED
   that currently they support one-time camera/microphone access.

   In addition, they SHOULD support requests for access that promise
   that media from this grant will be sent to a single communicating
   peer (obviously there could be other requests for other peers).
   E.g., "Call customerservice@ford.com".  The semantics of this request



Rescorla                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   are that the media stream from the camera and microphone will only be
   routed through a connection which has been cryptographically verified
   (through the IdP mechanism or an X.509 certificate in the DTLS-SRTP
   handshake) as being associated with the stated identity.  Note that
   it is unlikely that browsers would have an X.509 certificate, but
   servers might.  Browsers servicing such requests SHOULD clearly
   indicate that identity to the user when asking for permission.  The
   idea behind this type of permissions is that a user might have a
   fairly narrow list of peers he is willing to communicate with, e.g.,
   "my mother" rather than "anyone on Facebook".  Narrow permissions
   grants allow the browser to do that enforcement.

   API Requirement:  The API MUST provide a mechanism for the requesting
      JS to indicate which of these forms of permissions it is
      requesting.  This allows the browser client to know what sort of
      user interface experience to provide to the user, including what
      permissions to request from the user and hence what to enforce
      later.  For instance, browsers might display a non-invasive door
      hanger ("some features of this site may not work..." when asking
      for long-term permissions) but a more invasive UI ("here is your
      own video") for single-call permissions.  The API MAY grant weaker
      permissions than the JS asked for if the user chooses to authorize
      only those permissions, but if it intends to grant stronger ones
      it SHOULD display the appropriate UI for those permissions and
      MUST clearly indicate what permissions are being requested.

   API Requirement:  The API MUST provide a mechanism for the requesting
      JS to relinquish the ability to see or modify the media (e.g., via
      MediaStream.record()).  Combined with secure authentication of the
      communicating peer, this allows a user to be sure that the calling
      site is not accessing or modifying their conversion.

   UI Requirement:  The UI MUST clearly indicate when the user's camera
      and microphone are in use.  This indication MUST NOT be
      suppressable by the JS and MUST clearly indicate how to terminate
      device access, and provide a UI means to immediately stop camera/
      microphone input without the JS being able to prevent it.

   UI Requirement:  If the UI indication of camera/microphone use are
      displayed in the browser such that minimizing the browser window
      would hide the indication, or the JS creating an overlapping
      window would hide the indication, then the browser SHOULD stop
      camera and microphone input when the indication is hidden.  [Note:
      this may not be necessary in systems that are non-windows-based
      but that have good notifications support, such as phones.]

   [[OPEN ISSUE:  This section does not have WG consensus.  Because
   screen/application sharing presents a more significant risk than

   camera and microphone access (see the discussion in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security] S 4.1.1), we require a higher level of
   user consent.

   o  Browsers MUST not permit permanent screen or application sharing
      permissions to be installed as a response to a JS request for
      permissions.  Instead, they must require some other user action
      such as a permissions setting or an application install experience
      to grant permission to a site.
   o  Browsers MUST provide a separate dialog request for screen/
      application sharing permissions even if the media request is made
      at the same time as camera and microphone.
   o  The browser MUST indicate any windows which are currently being
      shared in some unambiguous way.  Windows which are not visible
      MUST not be shared even if the application is being shared.  If
      the screen is being shared, then that MUST be indicated.

   -- END OF OPEN ISSUE]]

   Clients MAY permit the formation of data channels without any direct
   user approval.  Because sites can always tunnel data through the
   server, further restrictions on the data channel do not provide any
   additional security. (though see Section 5.3 for a related issue).

   Implementations which support some form of direct user authentication
   SHOULD also provide a policy by which a user can authorize calls only
   to specific communicating peers.  Specifically, the implementation
   SHOULD provide the following interfaces/controls:

   o  Allow future calls to this verified user.
   o  Allow future calls to any verified user who is in my system
      address book (this only works with address book integration, of
      course).

   Implementations SHOULD also provide a different user interface
   indication when calls are in progress to users whose identities are
   directly verifiable.  Section 5.5 provides more on this.

5.3.  Communications Consent

   Browser client implementations of WebRTC MUST implement ICE.  Server
   gateway implementations which operate only at public IP addresses
   MUST implement either full ICE or ICE-Lite [RFC5245].

   Browser implementations MUST verify reachability via ICE prior to
   sending any non-ICE packets to a given destination.  Implementations
   MUST NOT provide the ICE transaction ID to JavaScript during the
   lifetime of the transaction (i.e., during the period when the ICE



Rescorla                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   stack would accept a new response for that transaction).  The JS MUST
   NOT be permitted to control the local ufrag and password, though it
   of course knows it.

   While continuing consent is required, that ICE [RFC5245]; Section 10
   keepalives STUN Binding Indications are one-way and therefore not
   sufficient.  The current WG consensus is to use ICE Binding Requests
   for continuing consent freshness.  ICE already requires that
   implementations respond to such requests, so this approach is
   maximally compatible.  A separate document will profile the ICE
   timers to be used; see [I-D.muthu-behave-consent-freshness].

5.4.  IP Location Privacy

   A side effect of the default ICE behavior is that the peer learns
   one's IP address, which leaks large amounts of location information.
   This has negative privacy consequences in some circumstances.  The
   API requirements in this section are intended to mitigate this issue.
   Note that these requirements are NOT intended to protect the user's
   IP address from a malicious site.  In general, the site will learn at
   least a user's server reflexive address from any HTTP transaction.
   Rather, these requirements are intended to allow a site to cooperate
   with the user to hide the user's IP address from the other side of
   the call.  Hiding the user's IP address from the server requires some
   sort of explicit privacy preserving mechanism on the client (e.g.,
   Torbutton [https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/]) and is out of
   scope for this specification.

   API Requirement:  The API MUST provide a mechanism to allow the JS to
      suppress ICE negotiation (though perhaps to allow candidate
      gathering) until the user has decided to answer the call [note:
      determining when the call has been answered is a question for the
      JS.]  This enables a user to prevent a peer from learning their IP
      address if they elect not to answer a call and also from learning
      whether the user is online.

   API Requirement:  The API MUST provide a mechanism for the calling
      application JS to indicate that only TURN candidates are to be
      used.  This prevents the peer from learning one's IP address at
      all.  This mechanism MUST also permit suppression of the related
      address field, since that leaks local addresses.

   API Requirement:  The API MUST provide a mechanism for the calling
      application to reconfigure an existing call to add non-TURN
      candidates.  Taken together, this and the previous requirement
      allow ICE negotiation to start immediately on incoming call
      notification, thus reducing post-dial delay, but also to avoid
      disclosing the user's IP address until they have decided to

      answer.  They also allow users to completely hide their IP address
      for the duration of the call.  Finally, they allow a mechanism for
      the user to optimize performance by reconfiguring to allow non-
      turn candidates during an active call if the user decides they no
      longer need to hide their IP address

   Note that some enterprises may operate proxies and/or NATs designed
   to hide internal IP addresses from the outside world.  WebRTC
   provides no explicit mechanism to allow this function.  Either such
   enterprises need to proxy the HTTP/HTTPS and modify the SDP and/or
   the JS, or there needs to be browser support to set the "TURN-only"
   policy regardless of the site's preferences.

5.5.  Communications Security

   Implementations MUST implement SRTP [RFC3711].  Implementations MUST
   implement DTLS [RFC4347] and DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763][RFC5764] for SRTP
   keying.  Implementations MUST implement
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].

   All media channels MUST be secured via SRTP.  Media traffic MUST NOT
   be sent over plain (unencrypted) RTP.  DTLS-SRTP MUST be offered for
   every media channel.  WebRTC implements MUST NOT offer SDES or select
   it if offered.

   All data channels MUST be secured via DTLS.

   [[OPEN ISSUE:  Are these the right cipher suites?]]  All
   implementations MUST implement the following two cipher suites:
   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and the DTLS-SRTP protection
   profile SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_80.  Implementations SHOULD favor
   cipher suites which support PFS over non-PFS cipher suites.

   API Requirement:  The API MUST provide a mechanism to indicate that a
      fresh DTLS key pair is to be generated for a specific call.  This
      is intended to allow for unlinkability.  Note that there are also
      settings where it is attractive to use the same keying material
      repeatedly, especially those with key continuity-based
      authentication.  Unless the user specifically configures an
      external key pair, different key pairs MUST be used for each
      origin.  (This avoids creating a super-cookie.)

   API Requirement:  When DTLS-SRTP is used, the API MUST NOT permit the
      JS to obtain the negotiated keying material.  This requirement
      preserves the end-to-end security of the media.

   UI Requirements:    A user-oriented client MUST provide an
      "inspector" interface which allows the user to determine the
      security characteristics of the media.
      The following properties SHOULD be displayed "up-front" in the
      browser chrome, i.e., without requiring the user to ask for them:

      *  A client MUST provide a user interface through which a user may
         determine the security characteristics for currently-displayed
         audio and video stream(s)
      *  A client MUST provide a user interface through which a user may
         determine the security characteristics for transmissions of
         their microphone audio and camera video.
      *  The "security characteristics" MUST include an indication as to
         whether the cryptographic keys were delivered out-of-band (from
         a server) or were generated as a result of a pairwise
         negotiation.
      *  If the far endpoint was directly verified, either via a third-
         party verifiable X.509 certificate or via a Web IdP mechanism
         (see Section 5.6) the "security characteristics" MUST include
         the verified information.  X.509 identities and Web IdP
         identities have similar semantics and should be displayed in a
         similar way.

      The following properties are more likely to require some "drill-
      down" from the user:

      *  The "security characteristics" MUST indicate the cryptographic
         algorithms in use (For example:  "AES-CBC" or "Null Cipher".)
         However, if Null ciphers are used, that MUST be presented to
         the user at the top-level UI.
      *  The "security characteristics" MUST indicate whether PFS is
         provided.
      *  The "security characteristics" MUST include some mechanism to
         allow an out-of-band verification of the peer, such as a
         certificate fingerprint or an SAS.

5.6.  Web-Based Peer Authentication

   In a number of cases, it is desirable for the endpoint (i.e., the
   browser) to be able to directly identity the endpoint on the other
   side without trusting only the signaling service to which they are
   connected.  For instance, users may be making a call via a federated
   system where they wish to get direct authentication of the other
   side.  Alternately, they may be making a call on a site which they
   minimally trust (such as a poker site) but to someone who has an
   identity on a site they do trust (such as a social network.)

   Recently, a number of Web-based identity technologies (OAuth,



Rescorla                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   BrowserID, Facebook Connect), etc. have been developed.  While the
   details vary, what these technologies share is that they have a Web-
   based (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS) identity provider which attests to your
   identity.  For instance, if I have an account at example.org, I could
   use the example.org identity provider to prove to others that I was
   alice@example.org.  The development of these technologies allows us
   to separate calling from identity provision:  I could call you on
   Poker Galaxy but identify myself as alice@example.org.

   Whatever the underlying technology, the general principle is that the
   party which is being authenticated is NOT the signaling site but
   rather the user (and their browser).  Similarly, the relying party is
   the browser and not the signaling site.  Thus, the browser MUST
   securely generate the input to the IdP assertion process and MUST
   securely display the results of the verification process to the user
   in a way which cannot be imitated by the calling site.

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not require the browser to
   implement any particular identity protocol or to support any
   particular IdP.  Instead, this document provides a generic interface
   which any IdP can implement.  Thus, new IdPs and protocols can be
   introduced without change to either the browser or the calling
   service.  This avoids the need to make a commitment to any particular
   identity protocol, although browsers may opt to directly implement
   some identity protocols in order to provide superior performance or
   UI properties.

5.6.1.  Trust Relationships: IdPs, APs, and RPs

   Any federated identity protocol has three major participants:

   Authenticating Party (AP):  The entity which is trying to establish
      its identity.

   Identity Provider (IdP):  The entity which is vouching for the AP's
      identity.

   Relying Party (RP):  The entity which is trying to verify the AP's
      identity.

   The AP and the IdP have an account relationship of some kind:  the AP
   registers with the IdP and is able to subsequently authenticate
   directly to the IdP (e.g., with a password).  This means that the
   browser must somehow know which IdP(s) the user has an account
   relationship with.  This can either be something that the user
   configures into the browser or that is configured at the calling site
   and then provided to the PeerConnection by the Web application at the
   calling site.  The use case for having this information configured



Rescorla                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   into the browser is that the user may "log into" the browser to bind
   it to some identity.  This is becoming common in new browsers.
   However, it should also be possible for the IdP information to simply
   be provided by the calling application.

   At a high level there are two kinds of IdPs:

   Authoritative:    IdPs which have verifiable control of some section
      of the identity space.  For instance, in the realm of e-mail, the
      operator of "example.com" has complete control of the namespace
      ending in "@example.com".  Thus, "alice@example.com" is whoever
      the operator says it is.  Examples of systems with authoritative
      identity providers include DNSSEC, RFC 4474, and Facebook Connect
      (Facebook identities only make sense within the context of the
      Facebook system).

   Third-Party:    IdPs which don't have control of their section of the
      identity space but instead verify user's identities via some
      unspecified mechanism and then attest to it.  Because the IdP
      doesn't actually control the namespace, RPs need to trust that the
      IdP is correctly verifying AP identities, and there can
      potentially be multiple IdPs attesting to the same section of the
      identity space.  Probably the best-known example of a third-party
      identity provider is SSL certificates, where there are a large
      number of CAs all of whom can attest to any domain name.

   If an AP is authenticating via an authoritative IdP, then the RP does
   not need to explicitly configure trust in the IdP at all.  The
   identity mechanism can directly verify that the IdP indeed made the
   relevant identity assertion (a function provided by the mechanisms in
   this document), and any assertion it makes about an identity for
   which it is authoritative is directly verifiable.  Note that this
   does not mean that the IdP might not lie, but that is a
   trustworthiness judgement that the user can make at the time he looks
   at the identity.

   By contrast, if an AP is authenticating via a third-party IdP, the RP
   needs to explicitly trust that IdP (hence the need for an explicit
   trust anchor list in PKI-based SSL/TLS clients).  The list of
   trustable IdPs needs to be configured directly into the browser,
   either by the user or potentially by the browser manufacturer.  This
   is a significant advantage of authoritative IdPs and implies that if
   third-party IdPs are to be supported, the potential number needs to
   be fairly small.

5.6.2.  Overview of Operation

   In order to provide security without trusting the calling site, the
   PeerConnection component of the browser must interact directly with
   the IdP.  The details of the mechanism are described in the W3C API
   specification, but the general idea is that the PeerConnection
   component downloads JS from a specific location on the IdP dictated
   by the IdP domain name.  That JS (the "IdP proxy") runs in an
   isolated security context within the browser and the PeerConnection
   talks to it via a secure message passing channel.

   Note that there are two logically separate functions here:

   o  Identity assertion generation.
   o  Identity assertion verification.

   The same IdP JS "endpoint" is used for both functions but of course a
   given IdP might behave differently and load new JS to perform one
   function or the other.

   When the PeerConnection object wants to interact with the IdP, the
   sequence of events is as follows:

   1.  The browser (the PeerConnection component) instantiates an IdP
       proxy with its source at the IdP.  This allows the IdP to load
       whatever JS is necessary into the proxy, which runs in the IdP's



Rescorla                 Expires August 18, 2014               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


       security context.
   2.  If the user is not already logged in, the IdP does whatever is
       required to log them in, such as soliciting a username and
       password.
   3.  Once the user is logged in, the IdP proxy notifies the browser
       that it is ready.
   4.  The browser and the IdP proxy communicate via a standardized
       series of messages delivered via a MessageChannel [WebMessaging].
       For instance, the browser might request the IdP proxy to sign or
       verify a given identity assertion.

   This approach allows us to decouple the browser from any particular
   identity provider; the browser need only know how to load the IdP's
   JavaScript--which is deterministic from the IdP's identity--and the
   generic protocol for requesting and verifying assertions.  The IdP
   provides whatever logic is necessary to bridge the generic protocol
   to the IdP's specific requirements.  Thus, a single browser can
   support any number of identity protocols, including being forward
   compatible with IdPs which did not exist at the time the browser was
   written.

5.6.3.  Items for Standardization

   In order to make this work, we must standardize the following items:

   o  The precise information from the signaling message that must be
      cryptographically bound to the user's identity and a mechanism for
      carrying assertions in JSEP messages.  Section 5.6.4
   o  The interface to the IdP.  Section 5.6.5 specifies a specific
      protocol mechanism which allows the use of any identity protocol
      without requiring specific further protocol support in the browser
   o  The JavaScript interfaces which the calling application can use to
      specify the IdP to use to generate assertions and to discover what
      assertions were received.

   The first two items are defined in this document.  The final one is
   defined in the companion W3C WebRTC API specification [webrtc-api].

5.6.4.  Binding Identity Assertions to JSEP Offer/Answer Transactions

5.6.4.1.  Input to Assertion Generation Process

   An identity assertion binds the user's identity (as asserted by the
   IdP) to the JSEP offer/exchange transaction and specifically to the
   media.  In order to achieve this, the PeerConnection must provide the
   DTLS-SRTP fingerprint to be bound to the identity.  This is provided
   as a JavaScript object (also known as a dictionary or hash) with a
   single "fingerprint" key, as shown below:

     {
       "fingerprint": {
         "algorithm": "sha-256",
         "digest": "4A:AD:B9:B1:3F:...:E5:7C:AB"
       }
     }


   This object is encoded in a JSON [RFC4627] string for passing to the
   IdP.

   The "algorithm" and "digest" values correspond directly to the
   algorithm and digest values in the a=fingerprint line of the SDP.
   [RFC4572].

   Note:  this structure does not need to be interpreted by the IdP or
   the IdP proxy.  It is consumed solely by the RP's browser.  The IdP
   merely treats it as an opaque value to be attested to.  Thus, new
   parameters can be added to the assertion without modifying the IdP.

5.6.4.2.  Carrying Identity Assertions

   Once an IdP has generated an assertion, it is attached to the SDP
   message.  This is done by adding a new a-line to the SDP, of the form
   a=identity.  The sole contents of this value are a base-64 encoded
   [RFC4848] identity assertion.  For example:

   v=0
   o=- 1181923068 1181923196 IN IP4 ua1.example.com
   s=example1
   c=IN IP4 ua1.example.com
   a=setup:actpass
   a=fingerprint:sha-1 \
     4A:AD:B9:B1:3F:82:18:3B:54:02:12:DF:3E:5D:49:6B:19:E5:7C:AB
   a=identity:\

   t=0 0
   m=audio 6056 RTP/SAVP 0
   a=sendrecv
   ...

   Each identity attribute should be paired (and attests to) with an
   "a=fingerprint" attribute and therefore can exist either at the
   session or media level.  Multiple identity attributes may appear at
   either level, though it is RECOMMENDED that implementations not do

   this, because it becomes very unclear what security claim that they
   are making and the UI guidelines above become unclear.  Browsers MAY
   choose refuse to display any identity indicators in the face of
   multiple identity attributes with different identities but SHOULD
   process multiple attributes with the same identity as described
   above.

   TODO:  write up paragraph on the consequences of multiple
   a=fingerprint attributes.

5.6.5.  IdP Interaction Details

5.6.5.1.  General Message Structure

   Messages between the PeerConnection object and the IdP proxy are
   JavaScript objects, shown in examples using JSON [RFC4627].  For
   instance, the PeerConnection would request a signature with the
   following "SIGN" message:

     {
       "type": "SIGN",
       "id": "1",
       "origin": "https://calling-site.example.com",
       "message": "012345678abcdefghijkl"
     }

   All messages MUST contain a "type" field which indicates the general
   meaning of the message.

   All requests from the PeerConnection object MUST contain an "id"
   field which MUST be unique within the scope of the interaction
   between the browser and the IdP instance.  Responses from the IdP
   proxy MUST contain the same "id" in response, which allows the
   PeerConnection to correlate requests and responses, in case there are
   multiple requests/responses outstanding to the same proxy.

   All requests from the PeerConnection object MUST contain an "origin"
   field containing the origin of the JS which initiated the PC (i.e.,
   the URL of the calling site).  This origin value can be used by the
   IdP to make access control decisions.  For instance, an IdP might
   only issue identity assertions for certain calling services in the
   same way that some IdPs require that relying Web sites have an API
   key before learning user identity.

   Any message-specific data is carried in a "message" field.  Depending
   on the message type, this may either be a string or any JavaScript
   object that can be conveyed in a message channel.  This includes any
   object that is able to be serialized to JSON.

5.6.5.2.  Errors

   If an error occurs, the IdP sends a message of type "ERROR".  The
   message MAY have an "error" field containing freeform text data which
   containing additional information about what happened.  For instance:

     {
       "type": "ERROR",
       "id": "1",
       "error": "Signature verification failed"
     }

                          Figure 5: Example error

5.6.5.3.  IdP Proxy Setup

   In order to perform an identity transaction, the PeerConnection must
   first create an IdP proxy.  While the details of this are specified
   in the W3C API document, from the perspective of this specification,
   however, the relevant facts are:

   o  The JS runs in the IdP's security context with the base page
      retrieved from the URL specified in Section 5.6.5.3.1.
   o  The usual browser sandbox isolation mechanisms MUST be enforced
      with respect to the IdP proxy.  The IdP cannot be provided with
      escalated privileges.
   o  JS running in the IdP proxy MUST be able to send and receive
      messages to the PeerConnection and the PC and IdP proxy are able
      to verify the source and destination of these messages.
   o  The IdP proxy is unable to interact with the user.  This includes
      the creation of popup windows and dialogs.

   Initially the IdP proxy is in an unready state; the IdP JS must be
   loaded and there may be several round trips to the IdP server to load
   and prepare necessary resources.

   When the IdP proxy is ready to receive commands, it delivers a
   "READY" message.  As this message is unsolicited, it contains only
   the "type":

     { "type":"READY" }

   Once the PeerConnection object receives the ready message, it can
   send commands to the IdP proxy.

5.6.5.3.1.  Determining the IdP URI

   In order to ensure that the IdP is under control of the domain owner
   rather than someone who merely has an account on the domain owner's
   server (e.g., in shared hosting scenarios), the IdP JavaScript is
   hosted at a deterministic location based on the IdP's domain name.
   Each IdP proxy instance is associated with two values:

   domain name:  The IdP's domain name
   protocol:  The specific IdP protocol which the IdP is using.  This is
      a completely IdP-specific string, but allows an IdP to implement
      two protocols in parallel.  This value may be the empty string.

   Each IdP MUST serve its initial entry page (i.e., the one loaded by
   the IdP proxy) from a well-known URI [RFC5785].  The well-known URI
   for an IdP proxy is formed from the following URI components:
   1.  The scheme, "https:".  An IdP MUST be loaded using HTTPS
       [RFC2818].
   2.  The authority, which is the IdP domain name.  The authority MAY
       contain a non-default port number.  Any port number is removed
       when determining if an asserted identity matches the name of the
       IdP.  The authority MUST NOT include a userinfo sub-component.
   3.  The path, starting with "/.well-known/idp-proxy/" and appended
       with the IdP protocol.  Note that the separator characters '/'
       (%2F) and '\' (%5C) MUST NOT be permitted in the protocol field,
       lest an attacker be able to direct requests outside of the
       controlled "/.well-known/" prefix.  Query and fragment values MAY
       be used by including '?' or '#' characters.
   For example, for the IdP "identity.example.com" and the protocol
   "example", the URL would be:

     https://example.com/.well-known/idp-proxy/example

5.6.5.3.1.1.  Authenticating Party

   How an AP determines the appropriate IdP domain is out of scope of
   this specification.  In general, however, the AP has some actual
   account relationship with the IdP, as this identity is what the IdP
   is attesting to.  Thus, the AP somehow supplies the IdP information
   to the browser.  Some potential mechanisms include:
   o  Provided by the user directly.
   o  Selected from some set of IdPs known to the calling site.  E.g., a
      button that shows "Authenticate via Facebook Connect"

5.6.5.3.1.2.  Relying Party

   Unlike the AP, the RP need not have any particular relationship with
   the IdP.  Rather, it needs to be able to process whatever assertion

Internet-Draft              WebRTC Sec. Arch.              February 2014


   is provided by the AP.  As the assertion contains the IdP's identity,
   the URI can be constructed directly from the assertion, and thus the
   RP can directly verify the technical validity of the assertion with
   no user interaction.  Authoritative assertions need only be
   verifiable.  Third-party assertions also MUST be verified against
   local policy, as described in Section 5.6.5.3.3.1.

5.6.5.3.2.  Requesting Assertions

   In order to request an assertion, the PeerConnection sends a "SIGN"
   message.  Aside from the mandatory fields, this message has a
   "message" field containing a string.  The string contains a JSON-
   encoded object containing certificate fingerprints but are treated as
   opaque from the perspective of the IdP.

   A successful response to a "SIGN" message contains a "message" field
   which is a JavaScript dictionary consisting of two fields:

   idp:  A dictionary containing the domain name of the provider and the
      protocol string.
   assertion:  An opaque value containing the assertion itself.  This is
      only interpretable by the IdP or its proxy.

   Figure 6 shows an example transaction, with the message "abcde..."
   (remember, the messages are opaque at this layer) being signed and
   bound to identity "ekr@example.org".  In this case, the message has
   presumably been digitally signed/MACed in some way that the IdP can
   later verify it, but this is an implementation detail and out of
   scope of this document.  Line breaks are inserted solely for
   readability.

   The "message" structure is serialized into JSON, base64-encoded
   [RFC4848], and placed in an "a=identity" attribute.

5.6.5.3.3.  Verifying Assertions

   In order to verify an assertion, an RP sends a "VERIFY" message to
   the IdP proxy containing the assertion supplied by the AP in the
   "message" field.

   The IdP proxy verifies the assertion.  Depending on the identity
   protocol, the proxy might contact the IdP server or other servers.
   For instance, an OAuth-based protocol will likely require using the
   IdP as an oracle, whereas with BrowserID the IdP proxy can likely
   verify the signature on the assertion without contacting the IdP,
   provided that it has cached the IdP's public key.

   Regardless of the mechanism, if verification succeeds, a successful
   response from the IdP proxy MUST contain a message field consisting
   of a object with the following fields:

5.6.5.3.3.1.  Identity Formats

   Identities passed from the IdP proxy to the PeerConnection are passed
   in the "identity" field.  This field MUST consist of a string
   representing the user's identity.  This string is in the form
   "<user>@<domain>", where "user" consists of any character except '@',
   and domain is an internationalized domain name [RFC5890].

   The PeerConnection API MUST check this string as follows:
   1.  If the domain portion of the string is equal to the domain name
       of the IdP proxy, then the assertion is valid, as the IdP is
       authoritative for this domain.  Comparison of domain names is
       done using the label equivalence rule defined in Section 2.3.2.4
       of [RFC5890].
   2.  If the domain portion of the string is not equal to the domain
       name of the IdP proxy, then the PeerConnection object MUST reject
       the assertion unless:

       1.  the IdP domain is trusted as an acceptable third-party IdP;
           and
       2.  local policy is configured to trust this IdP domain for the
           RHS of the identity string.

   Sites which have identities that do not fit into the RFC822 style
   (for instance, identifiers that are simple numeric values, or values
   that contain '@' characters) SHOULD convert them to this form by
   escaping illegal characters and appending their IdP domain (e.g.,
   user%40133@identity.example.com), thus ensuring that they are
   authoritative for the identity.

5.7.  Security Considerations

   Much of the security analysis of this problem is contained in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security] or in the discussion of the particular
   issues above.  In order to avoid repetition, this section focuses on
   (a) residual threats that are not addressed by this document and (b)
   threats produced by failure/misbehavior of one of the components in
   the system.

5.7.1.  Communications Security

   While this document favors DTLS-SRTP, it permits a variety of
   communications security mechanisms and thus the level of
   communications security actually provided varies considerably.  Any
   pair of implementations which have multiple security mechanisms in
   common are subject to being downgraded to the weakest of those common
   mechanisms by any attacker who can modify the signaling traffic.  If
   communications are over HTTP, this means any on-path attacker.  If
   communications are over HTTPS, this means the signaling server.
   Implementations which wish to avoid downgrade attack should only
   offer the strongest available mechanism, which is DTLS/DTLS-SRTP.
   Note that the implication of this choice will be that interop to non-
   DTLS-SRTP devices will need to happen through gateways.

   Even if only DTLS/DTLS-SRTP are used, the signaling server can
   potentially mount a man-in-the-middle attack unless implementations
   have some mechanism for independently verifying keys.  The UI
   requirements in Section 5.5 are designed to provide such a mechanism
   for motivated/security conscious users, but are not suitable for
   general use.  The identity service mechanisms in Section 5.6 are more
   suitable for general use.  Note, however, that a malicious signaling
   service can strip off any such identity assertions, though it cannot
   forge new ones.  Note that all of the third-party security mechanisms
   available (whether X.509 certificates or a third-party IdP) rely on
   the security of the third party--this is of course also true of your
   connection to the Web site itself.  Users who wish to assure

   themselves of security against a malicious identity provider can only
   do so by verifying peer credentials directly, e.g., by checking the
   peer's fingerprint against a value delivered out of band.

   In order to protect against malicious content JavaScript, that
   JavaScript MUST NOT be allowed to have direct access to---or perform
   computations with---DTLS keys.  For instance, if content JS were able
   to compute digital signatures, then it would be possible for content
   JS to get an identity assertion for a browser's generated key and
   then use that assertion plus a signature by the key to authenticate a
   call protected under an ephemeral DH key controlled by the content
   JS, thus violating the security guarantees otherwise provided by the
   IdP mechanism.  Note that it is not sufficient merely to deny the
   content JS direct access to the keys, as some have suggested doing
   with the WebCrypto API. [webcrypto].  The JS must also not be allowed
   to perform operations that would be valid for a DTLS endpoint.  By
   far the safest approach is simply to deny the ability to perform any
   operations that depend on secret information associated with the key.
   Operations that depend on public information, such as exporting the
   public key are of course safe.

5.7.2.  Privacy

   The requirements in this document are intended to allow:

   o  Users to participate in calls without revealing their location.
   o  Potential callees to avoid revealing their location and even
      presence status prior to agreeing to answer a call.

   However, these privacy protections come at a performance cost in
   terms of using TURN relays and, in the latter case, delaying ICE.
   Sites SHOULD make users aware of these tradeoffs.

   Note that the protections provided here assume a non-malicious
   calling service.  As the calling service always knows the users
   status and (absent the use of a technology like Tor) their IP
   address, they can violate the users privacy at will.  Users who wish
   privacy against the calling sites they are using must use separate
   privacy enhancing technologies such as Tor. Combined WebRTC/Tor
   implementations SHOULD arrange to route the media as well as the
   signaling through Tor. Currently this will produce very suboptimal
   performance.

   Additionally, any identifier which persists across multiple calls is
   potentially a problem for privacy, especially for anonymous calling
   services.  Such services SHOULD instruct the browser to use separate
   DTLS keys for each call and also to use TURN throughout the call.
   Otherwise, the other side will learn linkable information.

   Additionally, browsers SHOULD implement the privacy-preserving CNAME
   generation mode of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-6222bis].

5.7.3.  Denial of Service

   The consent mechanisms described in this document are intended to
   mitigate denial of service attacks in which an attacker uses clients
   to send large amounts of traffic to a victim without the consent of
   the victim.  While these mechanisms are sufficient to protect victims
   who have not implemented WebRTC at all, WebRTC implementations need
   to be more careful.

   Consider the case of a call center which accepts calls via RTCWeb.
   An attacker proxies the call center's front-end and arranges for
   multiple clients to initiate calls to the call center.  Note that
   this requires user consent in many cases but because the data channel
   does not need consent, he can use that directly.  Since ICE will
   complete, browsers can then be induced to send large amounts of data
   to the victim call center if it supports the data channel at all.
   Preventing this attack requires that automated WebRTC implementations
   implement sensible flow control and have the ability to triage out
   (i.e., stop responding to ICE probes on) calls which are behaving
   badly, and especially to be prepared to remotely throttle the data
   channel in the absence of plausible audio and video (which the
   attacker cannot control).

   Another related attack is for the signaling service to swap the ICE
   candidates for the audio and video streams, thus forcing a browser to
   send video to the sink that the other victim expects will contain
   audio (perhaps it is only expecting audio!) potentially causing
   overload.  Muxing multiple media flows over a single transport makes
   it harder to individually suppress a single flow by denying ICE
   keepalives.  Either media-level (RTCP) mechanisms must be used or the
   implementation must deny responses entirely, thus terminating the
   call.

   Yet another attack, suggested by Magnus Westerlund, is for the
   attacker to cross-connect offers and answers as follows.  It induces
   the victim to make a call and then uses its control of other users
   browsers to get them to attempt a call to someone.  It then
   translates their offers into apparent answers to the victim, which
   looks like large-scale parallel forking.  The victim still responds
   to ICE responses and now the browsers all try to send media to the
   victim.  Implementations can defend themselves from this attack by
   only responding to ICE Binding Requests for a limited number of
   remote ufrags (this is the reason for the requirement that the JS not
   be able to control the ufrag and password).

   Note that attacks based on confusing one end or the other about
   consent are possible even in the face of the third-party identity
   mechanism as long as major parts of the signaling messages are not
   signed.  On the other hand, signing the entire message severely
   restricts the capabilities of the calling application, so there are
   difficult tradeoffs here.

5.7.4.  IdP Authentication Mechanism

   This mechanism relies for its security on the IdP and on the
   PeerConnection correctly enforcing the security invariants described
   above.  At a high level, the IdP is attesting that the user
   identified in the assertion wishes to be associated with the
   assertion.  Thus, it must not be possible for arbitrary third parties
   to get assertions tied to a user or to produce assertions that RPs
   will accept.

5.7.4.1.  PeerConnection Origin Check

   Fundamentally, the IdP proxy is just a piece of HTML and JS loaded by
   the browser, so nothing stops a Web attacker o from creating their
   own IFRAME, loading the IdP proxy HTML/JS, and requesting a
   signature.  In order to prevent this attack, we require that all
   signatures be tied to a specific origin ("rtcweb://...") which cannot
   be produced by content JavaScript.  Thus, while an attacker can
   instantiate the IdP proxy, they cannot send messages from an
   appropriate origin and so cannot create acceptable assertions.  I.e.,
   the assertion request must have come from the browser.  This origin
   check is enforced on the relying party side, not on the
   authenticating party side.  The reason for this is to take the burden
   of knowing which origins are valid off of the IdP, thus making this
   mechanism extensible to other applications besides WebRTC.  The IdP
   simply needs to gather the origin information (from the posted
   message) and attach it to the assertion.

   Note that although this origin check is enforced on the RP side and
   not at the IdP, it is absolutely imperative that it be done.  The
   mechanisms in this document rely on the browser enforcing access
   restrictions on the DTLS keys and assertion requests which do not
   come with the right origin may be from content JS rather than from
   browsers, and therefore those access restrictions cannot be assumed.

   Note that this check only asserts that the browser (or some other
   entity with access to the user's authentication data) attests to the
   request and hence to the fingerprint.  It does not demonstrate that
   the browser has access to the associated private key.  However,
   attaching one's identity to a key that the user does not control does
   not appear to provide substantial leverage to an attacker, so a proof

   of possession is omitted for simplicity.

5.7.4.2.  IdP Well-known URI

   As described in Section 5.6.5.3.1 the IdP proxy HTML/JS landing page
   is located at a well-known URI based on the IdP's domain name.  This
   requirement prevents an attacker who can write some resources at the
   IdP (e.g., on one's Facebook wall) from being able to impersonate the
   IdP.

5.7.4.3.  Privacy of IdP-generated identities and the hosting site

   Depending on the structure of the IdP's assertions, the calling site
   may learn the user's identity from the perspective of the IdP.  In
   many cases this is not an issue because the user is authenticating to
   the site via the IdP in any case, for instance when the user has
   logged in with Facebook Connect and is then authenticating their call
   with a Facebook identity.  However, in other case, the user may not
   have already revealed their identity to the site.  In general, IdPs
   SHOULD either verify that the user is willing to have their identity
   revealed to the site (e.g., through the usual IdP permissions dialog)
   or arrange that the identity information is only available to known
   RPs (e.g., social graph adjacencies) but not to the calling site.
   The "origin" field of the signature request can be used to check that
   the user has agreed to disclose their identity to the calling site;
   because it is supplied by the PeerConnection it can be trusted to be
   correct.

5.7.4.4.  Security of Third-Party IdPs

   As discussed above, each third-party IdP represents a new universal
   trust point and therefore the number of these IdPs needs to be quite
   limited.  Most IdPs, even those which issue unqualified identities
   such as Facebook, can be recast as authoritative IdPs (e.g.,
   123456@facebook.com).  However, in such cases, the user interface
   implications are not entirely desirable.  One intermediate approach
   is to have special (potentially user configurable) UI for large
   authoritative IdPs, thus allowing the user to instantly grasp that
   the call is being authenticated by Facebook, Google, etc.

5.7.4.5.  Web Security Feature Interactions

   A number of optional Web security features have the potential to
   cause issues for this mechanism, as discussed below.

5.7.4.5.1.  Popup Blocking

   If the user is not already logged into the IdP, the IdP proxy may
   need to pop up a top level window in order to prompt the user for
   their authentication information (it is bad practice to do this in an
   IFRAME inside the window because then users have no way to determine
   the destination for their password).  If the user's browser is
   configured to prevent popups, this may fail (depending on the exact
   algorithm that the popup blocker uses to suppress popups).  It may be
   necessary to provide a standardized mechanism to allow the IdP proxy
   to request popping of a login window.  Note that care must be taken
   here to avoid PeerConnection becoming a general escape hatch from
   popup blocking.  One possibility would be to only allow popups when
   the user has explicitly registered a given IdP as one of theirs (this
   is only relevant at the AP side in any case).

5.7.4.5.2.  Third Party Cookies

   Some browsers allow users to block third party cookies (cookies
   associated with origins other than the top level page) for privacy
   reasons.  Any IdP which uses cookies to persist logins will be broken
   by third-party cookie blocking.  One option is to accept this as a
   limitation; another is to have the PeerConnection object disable
   third-party cookie blocking for the IdP proxy.

Appendix A.  Example IdP Bindings to Specific Protocols

   [[TODO:  These still need some cleanup.]]

   This section provides some examples of how the mechanisms described
   in this document could be used with existing authentication protocols
   such as BrowserID or OAuth.  Note that this does not require browser-
   level support for either protocol.  Rather, the protocols can be fit
   into the generic framework.  (Though BrowserID in particular works
   better with some client side support).

A.1.  BrowserID

   BrowserID [https://browserid.org/] is a technology which allows a
   user with a verified email address to generate an assertion
   (authenticated by their identity provider) attesting to their
   identity (phrased as an email address).  The way that this is used in
   practice is that the relying party embeds JS in their site which
   talks to the BrowserID code (either hosted on a trusted intermediary
   or embedded in the browser).  That code generates the assertion which
   is passed back to the relying party for verification.  The assertion
   can be verified directly or with a Web service provided by the
   identity provider.  It's relatively easy to extend this functionality
   to authenticate WebRTC calls, as shown below.

   The way this mechanism works is as follows.  On Alice's side, Alice
   goes to initiate a call.

   1.  The calling JS instantiates a PeerConnection and tells it that it
       is interested in having it authenticated via BrowserID (i.e., it
       provides "browserid.org" as the IdP name.)
   2.  The PeerConnection instantiates the BrowserID signer in the IdP
       proxy
   3.  The BrowserID signer contacts Alice's identity provider,
       authenticating as Alice (likely via a cookie).
   4.  The identity provider returns a short-term certificate attesting
       to Alice's identity and her short-term public key.
   5.  The Browser-ID code signs the fingerprint and returns the signed
       assertion + certificate to the PeerConnection.

   6.  The PeerConnection returns the signed information to the calling
       JS code.
   7.  The signed assertion gets sent over the wire to Bob's browser
       (via the signaling service) as part of the call setup.

   The offer might look something like:

        "type":"OFFER",

     "v=0\n

          },
          // Assertion contents are browserid-specific
          "assertion": "{
              \"assertion\": {
                \"digest\":\"<hash of the SIGN message>\",
                \"audience\": \"<audience>\"
                \"valid-until\": 1308859352261,

                \"signature\": \"<signature from example.org>\"
              },

        }
      ]]\n

   }

   Note that while the IdP here is specified as "browserid.org", the
   actual certificate is signed by example.org.  This is because
   BrowserID is a combined authoritative/third-party system in which
   browserid.org delegates the right to be authoritative (what BrowserID

   calls primary) to individual domains.

   On Bob's side, he receives the signed assertion as part of the call
   setup message and a similar procedure happens to verify it.

   1.  The calling JS instantiates a PeerConnection and provides it the
       relevant signaling information, including the signed assertion.
   2.  The PeerConnection instantiates the IdP proxy which examines the
       IdP name and brings up the BrowserID verification code.
   3.  The BrowserID verifier contacts the identity provider to verify
       the certificate and then uses the key to verify the signed
       fingerprint.
   4.  Alice's verified identity is returned to the PeerConnection (it
       already has the fingerprint).
   5.  At this point, Bob's browser can display a trusted UI indication
       that Alice is on the other end of the call.

   When Bob returns his answer, he follows the converse procedure, which
   provides Alice with a signed assertion of Bob's identity and keying
   material.

A.2.  OAuth

   While OAuth is not directly designed for user-to-user authentication,
   with a little lateral thinking it can be made to serve.  We use the
   following mapping of OAuth concepts to WebRTC concepts:

              +----------------------+----------------------+
              | OAuth                | WebRTC               |
              +----------------------+----------------------+
              | Client               | Relying party        |
              | Resource owner       | Authenticating party |
              | Authorization server | Identity service     |
              | Resource server      | Identity service     |
              +----------------------+----------------------+

                                  Table 1

   The idea here is that when Alice wants to authenticate to Bob (i.e.,
   for Bob to be aware that she is calling).  In order to do this, she
   allows Bob to see a resource on the identity provider that is bound
   to the call, her identity, and her public key.  Then Bob retrieves
   the resource from the identity provider, thus verifying the binding
   between Alice and the call.

           Alice                       IdP                       Bob
           ---------------------------------------------------------
           Call-Id, Fingerprint  ------->
           <------------------- Auth Code
           Auth Code ---------------------------------------------->
                                        <----- Get Token + Auth Code
                                        Token --------------------->
                                        <------------- Get call-info
                                        Call-Id, Fingerprint ------>

   This is a modified version of a common OAuth flow, but omits the
   redirects required to have the client point the resource owner to the
   IdP, which is acting as both the resource server and the
   authorization server, since Alice already has a handle to the IdP.

   Above, we have referred to "Alice", but really what we mean is the
   PeerConnection.  Specifically, the PeerConnection will instantiate an
   IFRAME with JS from the IdP and will use that IFRAME to communicate
   with the IdP, authenticating with Alice's identity (e.g., cookie).
   Similarly, Bob's PeerConnection instantiates an IFRAME to talk to the
   IdP.
